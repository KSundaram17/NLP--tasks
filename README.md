# Ubuntu-Conversation-Challenge
Challenge
There are two parts of this challenge. Feel free to create the solutions in the language or tool of your choice.

1: Choose your agents
You have been tasked with the selection of 15 users from the dataset to form the customer service agents for a new professional contact centre for Ubuntu support.

Using the data provided, select 15 users that you see in the dataset, and please provide validation with workings, summary statistics, and any visualisations to help motivate your selection.

To limit time, we would recommend generating appoximately 3 simple visualisations that you think would assist your choice and explaining how and why you used those.

2: Phatic-chat detector
Efficiency is key in any customer contact centre. Agents are expensive, and priced per minute.

For this challenge, you are tasked with building a phatic expression classifier. Phatic conversation is language used for general purposes of social interaction, rather than to convey information or ask questions. Utterances such as "hello, how are you?" and "nice morning, isn't it?" are phatic.

You need to design a classification model that can accurately detect the messages and sentences that add no significant information in the message data provided.

Examples of phatic conversation that we'd like to include:

Greetings: hello, hi, hi there, good morning, good evening, etc.
Farewells: bye, adios, see you later, good bye, etc.
Pleasantries: thanks, cheers, thank you, please, etc.
You are required to detect full messages that are made up of niceties, or sentences within longer messages that are niceties. You are not required to detect niceties within longer sentences. e.g. "Hey, I need help with my password."

With the classifier you design and build, the contact centre will build an automated system to remove niceties from messages, and reduce reading time for agents to operate more effectively.
